# Getting Started

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
1. Run `./setup` to download the Pin files and clone the Scarab repository. This script installs gdown (via `pip`) to enable downloading from Google Drive.  
1. Run `./build` to generate the Docker container. This step includes installing dependencies and compiling the Scarab source code, so it takes a few minutes.
1. Run `./run` to run the Docker container in interactive mode.
